Hi everyone who read this. This place is not suitable for childreen, as well as greats developpers.

It's where i'm talking about my own playground.
I will share my under learning experiences to own to build some mobiles apps. The good and the bad.

## Who am i ?
Well, i'm a developper (What ? No Really ? You've had somes pages on github and you're not something else, what a surprise).
I'm pretty good at ... Action Script, and PHP ... well. Believe me or not but you can accomplish some nice stuffs with this 2.
I've started playing with Django two years ago. And I fell in love with Python.
My work univers is database, web site, web app. And i need a new beginnig for my own sanity. (yes i'm looking at you html css and js).
I was born in 1977 in France, had 2 childreens, a lovely girlfriend.
... well without being to personnal, that's it.

## A github and a blog ?
Yes ! For some professional reason, before this december I can't use this great tools (for nearly 6 years, what a waste).
All my professional projects are close sourced; and it's not a personnal choise.
For my personnal project, except on rare exceptions I will open it on BSD licence. To give, and to get. This approche will force me to write better more documented codes, and have feed back on them.

## So ?
Everyone is welcome ! \o/
Kisses go to Louise, Nicolas, Sophie.
